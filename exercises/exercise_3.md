# Lambda exercise

* Create a lambda function that simply prints "hello, world!"

* Use any language you like (easiest is Python but you use other languages)

* Package the lambda function using AWS instructions.

* Deploy you lambda function (use can use the AWS cli tools or other options).

* Run your lambda function. You can do that from the console or using the cli tools.

## Phase II

* Trigger your lambda function on each time you get a message in your message queue.
