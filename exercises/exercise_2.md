# SQS exercise

* Create an `SQS` queue (give it your name).

* Open the `SQS` for the entire world (it is a security issue but that doesn't matter).

* write a python script to put/pull a message from your queue.

* run that python on your laptop and see that you can insert/remove messages from the queue.

* You will need to configure authentication properly.

* You will need to use the `boto3` python library.
